# ProfeC's dotfiles

A repository for diligently handcrafted (_or blatantly copied, in the spirit of open-source_) config files and nifty scripts for my systems.


## Installation

```dotfiles``` are managed and installed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot). To install these dotfiles simplly clone this repository and run the installation script.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Tunous/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/install [config file(s)] # chose correct config file for the distribution you're updating
```
